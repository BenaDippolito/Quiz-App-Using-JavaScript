Please save the Pexels hero photo here so the site uses a local copy.

Recommended filename (used by `index.html`):
  assets/hero.jpg

Suggested steps:
1. Download the photo from:
   https://www.pexels.com/photo/ethnic-freelancer-in-headphones-typing-on-laptop-at-home-7241616/
2. Optionally convert to WebP or optimized JPEG for faster loading.
3. Save it in this folder as `hero.jpg` (lowercase).

Notes on licensing:
- This image is from Pexels. Pexels allows free use, but check the image page for model/property release details if you plan commercial use.
- Keep the attribution in the page (`index.html`) if you want to preserve credit.

If you'd like, I can add the image file directly if you grant permission to fetch external media; otherwise drop the file in this folder and refresh the site.
